You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye,
Let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand
Beneath the pale moon light

But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine,
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone
